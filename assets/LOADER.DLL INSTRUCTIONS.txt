loader.dll is the dll that gets injected. It is responsible for doing the actual
loading of dll plugins into the game process.

This functionality is separated into a dll because this allows
us to do complicated/custom logic inside the target application rather than
doing a lot of work just to make one tiny remote process call. ðŸ¥º

loader.dll is not a plugin; rather, it is a support library for this application.
As such, it is incompatible with the native plugin system. It requires the
support application to properly function.

Keep loader.dll bundled together with bg3_injector.exe and bg3_watcher.exe
No additional setup is required. You can use the 2 apps as you normally would.

The application does file hash checks to ensure loader.dll is the same loader.dll
that shipped with the binary. It is not possible to mix and match loader.dll with
different app versions, accidentally use the wrong file, or to use a corrupted dll.
If the application starts without error, it is the correct file.
