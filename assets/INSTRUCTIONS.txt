----------------------------------------------------------

1. Place bg3_watcher.exe and bg3_injector.exe wherever you want, maybe create shortcuts to them even
   - bg3_watcher is a tool which stays running in the background. It watches for the launch of bg3 or
     bg3_dx11, and injects the plugins into the game. You can load your game through normal means, and
     it'll all be transparently patched in the background. This tool creates a tray icon. You can go
     to your taskbar to find the icon, right click on it, and press quit, when you are done using it.
   - bg3_injector.exe is a simpler, one-time use tool, which finds any instance of the game that's already
     running (vulkan or dx11), and injects the plugins into it at runtime. This is meant to be used on
     a normal game instance which has not loaded any native mods into it yet. The purpose of this tool
     is to be an alternative to the bg3_watcher tool, for those people who don't want a tool always running
     in the background. Please use it BEFORE loading a save. And only use it on a game instance which
     has NOT loaded any native mods into it yet. There is also no telling what may happen if you use
     it while your save is already running; or on a game which already has the plugins loaded into it.
     Also, plugins expect that they are run on the game process startup, so please run it as soon as
     possible.

2. Run one of the launchers.
   - You will see a popup with instructions, make sure to follow them.

3. Check the `config.toml` file inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - Edit as needed. It is recommended to leave `steam` option enabled. The game restarts twice while
     launching otherwise. (That is normal game behavior, it is not a bug)
   - If steam/the game was installed to a non-standard path, you must adjust this path to correct it.
     It needs to point to the game's root installation directory.
     E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3`

4. Place any dll plugins you have inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - NativeModLoader plugins are compatible!

5. If you wish to disable a mod, add an entry without extension to the `disabled` key
   - For example, if you have `FooBar.dll` and `FooBaz.dll` plugins, the entry looks like:
     disabled = ["FooBar", "FooBaz"]
   - If you wish to disable all plugins, just launch the game normally using steam instead.
     The launcher can only patch plugins into the game when it's used, so this is an easy way to
     disable it.

IMPORTANT: Read the FAQ!
           It may sometimes appear like your BG3 profile/saves got deleted when you launch the game.
           They did not. This launcher DOES NOT touch ANY of your game files or game data.
           This is harmless (but annoying). What's happening is the game is making/launching into a
           Debug profile instead of your regular profile. It appears to be intentionally designed
           that way. If it happens to you, go to:
           `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles`
           and delete any debug profiles you see. The main profile people generally use is `Public`.
           Launching steam and the game launcher manually first might help so the game doesn't
           recreate that, and launches into `Public` profile instead.
           If you have any trouble getting it to correctly launch, I offer some suggestions in the FAQ.
           It's important to remember - it is the game itself doing this - not the launcher.
           The game does this regardless in certain situations, and I have no control over that.
