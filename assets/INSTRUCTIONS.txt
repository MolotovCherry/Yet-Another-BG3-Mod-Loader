----------------------------------------------------------

1. Place the bg3.exe and bg3_dx11.exe files wherever you want, maybe create shortcuts to them even
   - These files directly correspond to bg3's files. bg3 is the vulkan launcher, bg3_dx11 is the dx11 launcher.
     Each respective file will set the mode for the official launcher before starting the game, so the game
     correctly starts in that mode.

2. Run one of the launchers.
   - You will see a popup with instructions, make sure to follow them.

3. Check the `config.toml` file inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - Edit as needed. It is recommended to leave `steam` option enabled. The game restarts twice while
     launching otherwise. (That is normal game behavior, it is not a bug)
   - If steam/the game was installed to a non-standard path, you must adjust this path to correct it.
     It needs to point to the game's root installation directory.
     E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3`

4. Place any dll plugins you have inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - NativeModLoader plugins are compatible!

5. If you wish to disable a mod, add an entry without extension to the `disabled` key
   - For example, if you have `FooBar.dll` and `FooBaz.dll` plugins, the entry looks like:
     disabled = ["FooBar", "FooBaz"]
   - If you wish to disable all plugins, just launch the game normally using steam instead.
     The launcher can only patch plugins into the game when it's used, so this is an easy way to
     disable it.

IMPORTANT: Read the FAQ!
           It may sometimes appear like your BG3 profile/saves got deleted when you launch the game.
           They did not. This launcher DOES NOT touch ANY of your game files or game data.
           This is harmless (but annoying). What's happening is the game is making/launching into a
           Debug profile instead of your regular profile. It appears to be intentionally designed
           that way. If it happens to you, go to:
           `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles`
           and delete any debug profiles you see. The main profile people generally use is `Public`.
           Launching steam and the game launcher manually first might help so the game doesn't
           recreate that, and launches into `Public` profile instead.
           If you have any trouble getting it to correctly launch, I offer some suggestions in the FAQ.
           It's important to remember - it is the game itself doing this - not the launcher.
           The game does this regardless in certain situations, and I have no control over that.
