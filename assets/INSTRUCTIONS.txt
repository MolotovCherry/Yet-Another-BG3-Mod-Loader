 Place bg3_watcher.exe and bg3_injector.exe wherever you want, maybe create shortcuts to them even
   - bg3_watcher is a tool which stays running in the background. It watches for the launch of bg3 or
     bg3_dx11, and injects the plugins into the game. You can load your game through normal means, and
     it'll all be transparently patched in the background. This tool creates a tray icon. You can go
     to your taskbar to find the icon, right click on it, and press quit, when you are done using it.
   - bg3_injector.exe is a simpler, one-time use tool, which finds any instance of the game that's already
     running (vulkan or dx11), and injects the plugins into it at runtime. This is meant to be used on
     a normal game instance which has not loaded any native mods into it yet. The purpose of this tool
     is to be an alternative to the bg3_watcher tool, for those people who don't want a tool always running
     in the background. Please use it BEFORE loading a save. And only use it on a game instance which
     has NOT loaded any native mods into it yet. There is also no telling what may happen if you use
     it while your save is already running; or on a game which already has the plugins loaded into it.
     Also, plugins expect that they are run on the game process startup, so please run it as soon as
     possible.

Watcher:
   - When you run it, it will stay running in the background with a tray icon (you can exit it from the
     tray icon)
   - It will silently watch for any game launches, and inject plugins into the game once it runs.

Injector:
   - When you run it, it will look for any currently running game instances, inject plugins into it,
     then exit.
   - Have a non-native modded game instance running before running it
   - Please only run the tool on non-modded game instances, and before you load any save games

The first time you run a tool:
   - It will generate config.toml for you
   - Check the `config.toml` file inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - If the game was installed to a non-standard path, you must adjust this path to correct it.
     It needs to point to the game's root installation directory.
     E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3`

Place any dll plugins you have inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - NativeModLoader plugins are compatible!

If you wish to disable a mod, add an entry without extension to the `disabled` key
   - For example, if you have `FooBar.dll` and `FooBaz.dll` plugins, the entry looks like:
     disabled = ["FooBar", "FooBaz"]
   - If you wish to disable all plugins easily, just quit the watcher tool if it's running, and
     start the game normally as you always do.
