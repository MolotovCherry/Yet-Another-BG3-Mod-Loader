 Place bg3_watcher.exe, bg3_injector.exe, bg3_autostart, and loader.dll wherever you want,
 maybe create shortcuts to them. Keep all these files together, including loader.dll.

   - bg3_watcher is a tool which stays running in the background. It watches for the launch of bg3 or
     bg3_dx11, and injects the plugins into the game. You can load your game through normal means, and
     it'll all be transparently patched in the background. This tool creates a tray icon. You can go
     to your taskbar to find the icon, right click on it, and press quit, when you are done using it.

     The benefit of this tool is that it doesn't require installation, and if you don't want plugins
     running, just don't start the tool. The downside is it requires manual running.

   - bg3_injector.exe is a simpler, one-time use tool, which finds any instance of the game that's already
     running (vulkan or dx11), and injects the plugins into it at runtime. The purpose of this
     tool is to be an alternative to bg3_watcher; for those people who don't want a tool always
     running in the background.

     The benefit of this tool is that it doesn't require installation, and if you don't want plugins
     running, just don't start the tool. The downside is it requires manual running.

     Please use it BEFORE loading a save. Plugins expect that they are run on the game process startup,
     so please run it as soon as possible.

   - bg3_autostart.exe automatically patches the game when it runs. It does not need to ever be manually run;
     it starts when the game starts, and stops when the game stops. Just like Native Mod Loader, it is seamless.
     This does however require extra registry edits.

     The benefit of this tool is that it doesn't require manual starting. The downside is it requires installation,
     and it is more work to disable it if you don't want plugins running (since that requires you to uninstall it).

     To install this tool, run install.bat, and to uninstall run uninstall.bat.

     Once you install, you must not move the exe. If you wish to move it, uninstall, move the tool, then reinstall it.
     Please also note that the registry entries point at the current bg3_autostart.exe location. If this file is in your
     windows user folder and another windows user tries to launch the game, they may not have access to the exe in your
     windows user folder (since it's another windows user's files). If multiple windows users play this game, you should
     instead place this exe at a location accessible by all windows users to avoid this problem.

     Also, if you delete the tools, make sure to uninstall first!

     The two registry entries added/removed are. You may also remove these manually if you wish.
       HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\bg3.exe
       HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\bg3_dx11.exe

--------------------------

The first time you run a tool, it will:
   - Generate a config.toml for you
   - Check the `config.toml` file inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - If the game was installed to a non-standard path, you must adjust this path to correct it.
     It needs to point to the game's root installation directory.
     E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3`
   - If the tools are placed in <bg3_root>/bin or <bg3_root>/bin/subfolder, they will detect the install root
     automatically, and install_root in config.toml won't require configuring.
   - Place any dll plugins you have inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - Remember, all NativeModLoader plugins are compatible!

Watcher:
   - This will silently run in the background and watch for game launches. Once the game launches,
     it will auto-patch the game instance. When you're done using the tool, go to the systray, right
     click on the icon, and click Quit
   1. Run the watcher tool
   2. When the game launches, it will auto-patch the game instance

Injector:
   - This tool is similar to the watcher, but it is a one-time use tool. It is useful if you don't
     want the watcher tool always running in the background.
   1. Start your game.
   2. Start the injector tool.*

   * If you start too late, some plugins may not properly load. You could try starting the injector tool
     first, then the game after to fix this. As long as you start the game within 10 seconds, it'll work.

Autostart:
   1. Run your game as normal. It will automatically be patched.

If you wish to disable a mod, add an entry without extension to the `disabled` key
   - For example, if you have `FooBar.dll` and `FooBaz.dll` plugins, the entry looks like:
     disabled = ["FooBar", "FooBaz"]
   - If you wish to disable all plugins, don't run the injector, quit the watcher tool if it's running,
     and if autostart was installed, uninstall it; then start the game normally as you always do.
