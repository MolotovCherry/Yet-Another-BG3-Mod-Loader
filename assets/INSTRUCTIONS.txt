 Place bg3_watcher.exe and bg3_injector.exe wherever you want, maybe create shortcuts to them even

   - bg3_watcher is a tool which stays running in the background. It watches for the launch of bg3 or
     bg3_dx11, and injects the plugins into the game. You can load your game through normal means, and
     it'll all be transparently patched in the background. This tool creates a tray icon. You can go
     to your taskbar to find the icon, right click on it, and press quit, when you are done using it.

   - bg3_injector.exe is a simpler, one-time use tool, which finds any instance of the game that's already
     running (vulkan or dx11), and injects the plugins into it at runtime. The purpose of this
     tool is to be an alternative to bg3_watcher; for those people who don't want a tool always
     running in the background.

     Please use it BEFORE loading a save. Plugins expect that they are run on the game process startup,
     so please run it as soon as possible.

--------------------------

The first time you run a tool, it will:
   - Generate a config.toml for you
   - Check the `config.toml` file inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - If the game was installed to a non-standard path, you must adjust this path to correct it.
     It needs to point to the game's root installation directory.
     E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3`
   - Place any dll plugins you have inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - Remember, all NativeModLoader plugins are compatible!

Watcher:
   - This will silently run in the background and watch for game launches. Once the game launches,
     it will auto-patch the game instance. When you're done using the tool, go to the systray, right
     click on the icon, and click Quit
   1. Run the watcher tool
   2. When the game launches, it will auto-patch the game instance

Injector:
   - This tool is similar to the watcher, but it is a one-time use tool. It is useful if you don't
     want the watcher tool always running in the background.
   1. Start your game.
   2. Start the injector tool.

If you wish to disable a mod, add an entry without extension to the `disabled` key
   - For example, if you have `FooBar.dll` and `FooBaz.dll` plugins, the entry looks like:
     disabled = ["FooBar", "FooBaz"]
   - If you wish to disable all plugins easily, just quit the watcher tool if it's running, and
     start the game normally as you always do.
