Place bg3_injector.exe and loader.dll wherever you want, maybe create a shortcut
to it. Keep all these files together, including loader.dll.

    bg3_injector.exe is a simpler, one-time use tool, which finds any instance of
    the game that's already running (vulkan or dx11), and injects the plugins
    into it at runtime. The purpose of this tool is to be an alternative to
    bg3_watcher; for those people who don't want a tool always running in the
    background.

    The benefit of this tool is that it doesn't require installation, and if you
    don't want plugins running, just don't start the tool. The downside is it
    requires manual running.

    Please use it BEFORE loading a save. Plugins expect that they are run on the
    game process startup, so please run it as soon as possible.

--------------------------

The first time you run a tool, it will:
   - Generate a config.toml for you
   - Check the `config.toml` file inside
     `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - If the game was installed to a non-standard path, you must adjust this path
     to correct it. It needs to point to the game's root installation directory.
     E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3`
   - If the tools are placed in <bg3_root>/bin or <bg3_root>/bin/subfolder, they
     will detect the install root automatically, and install_root in config.toml
     won't require configuring.
   - Place any dll plugins you have inside
     `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - Remember, all NativeModLoader plugins are compatible!

Using:
   - This tool is similar to the watcher, but it is a one-time use tool. It is
     useful if you don't want the watcher tool always running in the background.
   1. Start your game.
   2. Start the injector tool.*

   * If you start too late, some plugins may not properly load. You could try
     starting the injector tool first, then the game after to fix this. As long
     as you start the game within 10 seconds, it'll work.

If you wish to disable a mod, add an entry without extension to the `disabled` key
   - For example, if you have `FooBar.dll` and `FooBaz.dll` plugins, the entry
     looks like:
     disabled = ["FooBar", "FooBaz"]
   - If you wish to disable all plugins, don't run the injector, and then start the
     game normally as you always do.
