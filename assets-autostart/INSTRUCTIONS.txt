Place bg3_autostart.exe and loader.dll wherever you want. Keep all these files
together, including loader.dll.

    bg3_autostart.exe automatically patches the game. It does not need to be
    manually run; it starts when the game starts, and stops when the game stops.
    Just like Native Mod Loader, it is seamless. This does however require extra
    registry edits to accomplish.

    The benefit of this tool is that it doesn't require manual starting. It can
    be disabled without uninstalling through the config (see below in steps).

    To install this tool, run install.bat, and to uninstall run uninstall.bat.

    Once you install, you MUST not move the exe. If you wish to move it,
    uninstall, move the tool, then reinstall it.

    Please also note that the registry entries point at the current
    bg3_autostart.exe location. If this file is in your windows user folder and
    another windows user tries to launch the game, they may not have access to
    the exe in your windows user folder (since it's another windows user's files).
    If multiple windows users play this game, you should instead place this exe
    at a location accessible by all windows users to avoid this problem.

    Also, if you delete the tools, you MUST uninstall using uninstall.bat!
    Failure to do so will cause your game to stop starting! (This does not ruin
    your game; it's only a temporary effect until you run uninstall.bat)

    The two registry entries added/edited are (below). To uninstall, delete the
    `debugger` value from both keys, or delete the keys entirely. (If you delete
    the entire key, you may lose some windows settings for that particular exe.
    It is still FINE if you delete the key however)
        HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\bg3.exe
        HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\bg3_dx11.exe

--------------------------

The first time you run a tool, it will:
    - Generate a config.toml for you
    - Check the `config.toml` file inside
      `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
    - If the game was installed to a non-standard path, you must adjust this path
      to correct it. It needs to point to the game's root installation directory.
      E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3`
    - If the tools are placed in <bg3_root>/bin or <bg3_root>/bin/subfolder, they
      will detect the install root automatically, and install_root in config.toml
      won't require configuring.
    - Place any dll plugins you have inside
      `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
    - Remember, all NativeModLoader plugins are compatible!

Using:
    1. Run your game as normal. It will automatically be patched.

Disabling:
    To disable a specific plugin, either move/delete the plugin dll, or set the
    `[core]disabled_plugins` key to an array of plugin filenames (no extension).
    For example, if you have `FooBar.dll` and `FooBaz.dll` plugins, they can be
    disabled with:
        disabled_plugins = ["FooBar", "FooBaz"]

    To globally disable plugins, set the `[core]enabled` key to false, or uninstall
    the autostart tool:
        enabled = false
