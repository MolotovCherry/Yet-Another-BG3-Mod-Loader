Place bg3_watcher.exe and loader.dll wherever you want, maybe create a shortcut
to it. Keep all these files together, including loader.dll.

    bg3_watcher is a tool which stays running in the background. It watches for
    the launch of bg3 or bg3_dx11, and injects the plugins into the game. You
    can load your game through normal means, and it'll all be transparently
    patched in the background. This tool creates a tray icon. You can go to your
    taskbar to find the icon, right click on it, and press quit, when you are
    done using it.

    The benefit of this tool is that it doesn't require installation, and if you
    don't want plugins running, just don't start the tool. The downside is it
    requires manual running.

--------------------------

The first time you run a tool, it will:
   - Generate a config.toml for you
   - Check the `config.toml` file inside
     `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - If the game was installed to a non-standard path, you must adjust this path
     to correct it. It needs to point to the game's root installation directory.
     E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3`
   - If the tools are placed in <bg3_root>/bin or <bg3_root>/bin/subfolder, they
     will detect the install root automatically, and install_root in config.toml
     won't require configuring.
   - Place any dll plugins you have inside
     `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Plugins`
   - Remember, all NativeModLoader plugins are compatible!

Using:
   - This will silently run in the background and watch for game launches. Once
     the game launches, it will auto-patch the game instance. When you're done
     using the tool, go to the systray, right click on the icon, and click Quit
   1. Run the watcher tool
   2. When the game launches, it will auto-patch the game instance

Disabling:
    To disable a specific plugin, either move/delete the plugin dll, or set the
    `[core]disabled_plugins` key to an array of plugin filenames (no extension).
    For example, if you have `FooBar.dll` and `FooBaz.dll` plugins, they can be
    disabled with:
        disabled_plugins = ["FooBar", "FooBaz"]

    To globally disable plugins, set the `[core]enabled` key to false, or simply
    don't start the watcher tool:
        enabled = false
